Analyzing Sleep Patterns 

Use your Google Takeout data to infer your sleep patterns for at least a month, under the assumption that these can be determined from your use of Google applications.  Create visualizations of the data using software such as Excel or scientific graphing programs.  Write a report of at least 1500 words discussing your data sources, hypotheses (if any), methods, results, and insights gained.  Be prepared to give a 2 minute "lightning talk" (one slide) about your project.

Your project will be strengthened if you can measure how accurately the data allows you to measure your sleep schedule.  Consider keeping a written record of when you go to bed and when you wake up for a few weeks.  If you use a sleep-tracking smartwatch or activity tracker, use its data as ground truth.

The Google Takeout data most relevant to this project is your Chome browsing history, which contains your search history as well, and your YouTube history.  On the Google Takeout page, first deselect all categories, and then select Chrome and "YouTube and YouTube Music".  You can select whether to receive an email with a link when the data is ready to download or to have it automatically added to your Google Drive.  If you stay on the Takeout page, you will also be able to access the data your "Your latest export".  You will need to figure out (with help from ChatGPT!) how to read the JASON files,  how to convert the timestamps into clock time and dates, and (if you choose to do so) how to distinguish searches from other web pages browsed.

Unfortunately, Google recently removed the ability to specify a time range for Takeout, so you will get your complete history.  Note that it can take hours or days for Google to create the takeout zip file(s), so be sure to get started on this as soon as you can.

If you do not use Google services, you will need to find an alternative source of data.  For example, if you use Safari on an iPhone, you could download your browsing history and use the timestamps of visited pages.  You can download the data directly on the iPhone, or if you sync Safari with iCloud, from Safari on your MacBook.

Place the code for your project in a public GitHub repository, and include the URL for the repository in your report.

Upload the 1 slide summary by Sunday February 23 at 11:59pm.  Use the names of all the people in your group as the filename.  The slide must be in Microsoft Powerpoint format.  If you use different presentation software, export it to pptx format or export as an image and paste into an a Powerpoint slide.  Only one member of your group need upload it.

Upload the report by Monday February 24 at 11:59pm.  This is the day for the lightning presentations. Use the names of all the people in your group as the filename. The report should be PDF (preferred) or Microsoft Word.
